# ðŸ›  Workflow Engine â€“ .NET Core 9 (CQRS + DDD)

A modular, scalable **Workflow Engine** developed in **C# (.NET Core 9)** for managing dynamic e-service transactions involving both **customers** and **employees**. It supports runtime task assignment to **Active Directory groups** and external users, built with clean architectural patterns for high maintainability and extensibility.
